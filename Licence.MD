#Licence
Do not remove any of the commands in the mod as they need to stay due to it being a addon to TotalFreedomMod.
Please do not Remove any of the developers from TFM_Util, Also remember to keep the mod credits in there like AssistFreedom made by Bladezo whitch is an addon for TotalFreedomMod made by Madgeek and Prozza.
Keep all of the commands in the Mod as this is not a copy of TFM to use for making your own custom version it is just simply an addon and if you did just remove all the commands then the addon is pointless.
If you wish to make your own custom version of TotalFreedomMod you can do so on the official TotalFreedomMod github page.
Also read the Official TotalFreedomMod License.
